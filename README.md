# Driving Test Show me Tell Me Quiz

This Python script simulates a driving test quiz with "Show Me" and "Tell Me" questions. The quiz helps you practice and prepare for the theory part of a driving test by providing multiple-choice questions with shuffled answer options. The script ensures that the correct answer isnâ€™t obvious by adjusting the length of the options and randomly shuffling them.

## Features

- "Show Me" and "Tell Me" driving test questions.
- Multiple-choice format with randomized answer order.
- Feedback on whether the answer was correct or incorrect after each question.
- Displays the total score at the end of the quiz.
